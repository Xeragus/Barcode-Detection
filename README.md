# Barcode-Detection
Python script that detects barcode in images. 

The script uses Numpy and CV2 so you have to have them installed before using it. When you call the script, pass the name of the image (few dummy images are located in the images folder) as an argument in the console. 

For example: python script.py barcode_01
